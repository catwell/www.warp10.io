The WarpScript data manipulation environment allows the retrieval and analysis of data stored in the Warp 10 storage platform.

WarpScript is an extensible [stack oriented programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming_language) which offers more than 600 functions and several high level frameworks to ease and speed your data analysis. Simply create scripts containing your data analysis code and submit them to the platform, they will execute close to where the data resides and you will get the result of that analysis as a JSON object that you can integrate into your application.

The WarpScript approach is another differentiating factor of Warp 10. Traditional time series platforms offer few manipulation options, usually only providing a SQL like query language which cannot express complex analysis, or providing a reduced set of aggregation functions. These approaches force you to produce more code on the client side thus increasing your development time and leading to massive transfers of unprocessed data from the platform to your applications. Our approach lets you focus on your business use cases, simplifying IoT and sensor data applications by taking care of a larger chunk of the data analysis in a very efficient way.
