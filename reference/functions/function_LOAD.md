The `LOAD` function pushes onto the stack the value associated with the symbol name present on top of the stack. It is an alternative to `$symbol`.

## Example ##

{% raw %}
<warp10-warpscript-widget backend="{{backend}}"  exec-endpoint="{{execEndpoint}}">42 'foo' STORE
'foo' LOAD
</warp10-warpscript-widget>
{% endraw %}
