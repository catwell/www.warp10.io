Warp 10 does not force data stored in a given Geo Time Series to be of a single type, but it forces a single type when manipulating the data.

`FETCHDOUBLE` fetches data from the store, forcing the returned Geo Time Series to be of type DOUBLE.

The syntax of the parameters of `FETCHDOUBLE` is a list of parameters identical to that supported by  `FETCH`.

```
[ 'token' 'class_selector' { labels_selectors } now timespan ]  FETCHDOUBLE [ gts ]
```
