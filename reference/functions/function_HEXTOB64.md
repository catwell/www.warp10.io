Decodes the hex encoded content on top of the stack and immediately re-encode it in base64. This enables you to convert encoded content which would not be valid UTF-8 encoding from hexadecimal to base64.

## Example ##

{% raw %}
<warp10-warpscript-widget backend="{{backend}}"  exec-endpoint="{{execEndpoint}}">'010203'
HEXTOB64
</warp10-warpscript-widget>
{% endraw %}
